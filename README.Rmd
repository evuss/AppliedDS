## Working with databases

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

driver = "SQL Server"
server = "fbmcsads.database.windows.net"
Database = "WideWorldImporters-Standard"
uid = "adatumadmin"
Pwd = "Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd"


con <- dbConnect(odbc(),
                 driver=driver,
                 server=server,
                 database=Database,
                 pwd=Pwd,
                 uid=uid
                 )
